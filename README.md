## PROJET TITLE: Data Cleaning and Analysis Task

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
This Data Analysis project aims to generate 
     - a cleaned dataset with duplicate IDs removed and infinite values handleed,
     - a summary table showing total quantity and total value per region and 
     - a short report explaining the steps and insights from the cleaned data.

## DATA ANALYSIS
1. A cleaned data

      - click on remove duplicate then select only ID and click OK
        And All the duplicate in ID Column will be gone

      - highlight the rows with inf value and blank spaces
      - press ctrl + - , a box will display
      - select entire row and then click OK
        And all the rows with inf value and blank spaces will be gone
      
Steps For a Summay Table Showing Total Quantity and Total Value Per Region

      - highlight the entire dataset, go to Insert icon on the menu bar and click
      - click on pivot table, a box will display then click
      - a new worksheet will open with a pivot table field list open on right hand side of it
      - select region and then select quantity, on the left hand side a summary table of total quantity per region will emerge
      - the same goes for summary table of total value per region

### INSIGHT ON CLEANED DATA
I noticed that cleaning the data , the dataset that was 32 in number reduces to 22.
